description: Create separate commits using conventional commit format for related file changes
---

Create separate commits for the files changed, grouping related changes together (i.e., changes that are in the same domain/realm should be staged and committed together).

## Requirements
- Use the conventional commit format
- Group related changes logically by domain/functionality
- Generate descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the changes
- Ensure each commit represents a logical unit of work
